  <p class="body">Hong Yong Sohn received his B.S. degree from Seoul National University in Korea and his Ph.D. degree in Chemical Engineering in 1970 from the University of California at Berkeley.  After working as a Research Engineer at Du Pont’s Engineering Technology Laboratory, he joined the Department of Metallurgical Engineering at the University of Utah in 1974 and currently holds the rank of <b>Distinguished Professor</b>. Professor Sohn’s work has been recognized through various awards, which include the 2014 <b>Educator Award</b> from TMS; the <b>Distinguished Scholarly and Creative Research Award</b>, 2012, University of Utah; <B>Billiton Gold Medal</b>, 2012, The Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining, U.K.; the <b>TMS 2009 Fellow Award</b>, “in recognition of outstanding contribution to the practice of metallurgical/materials science and technology,” from The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society (TMS); the 2001 <b>James Douglas Gold Medal Award</b> (“for leadership and outstanding contributions in research and education of nonferrous extractive metallurgy and for work related to the modeling of gas-solid reactors and the development of novel solvent extraction systems”) from the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers (AIME); <b>Fellow Award</b> from the Korean Academy of Science and Technology, 1998; the TMS <b>Champion H. Mathewson Gold Medal Award</b> (1993 “for the most notable contribution to Metallurgical Science in the 3–year period”); the TMS <b>Extractive Metallurgy Lecturer Award</b> (1990 “in recognition as an outstanding scientific leader in the field of nonferrous extraction and processing metallurgy”); the TMS <b>Extraction and Processing Science Award (1990, 1994, 1999 and 2007)</b>; the <b>Fulbright Distinguished Lecturer</b> (1983); and the <b>Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation Teacher-Scholar Award</b> (1977). In 2006 TMS honored Dr. Sohn by holding the “<b>Sohn International Symposium on Advanced Processing of Metals and Materials</b>” in 2006.</p>
