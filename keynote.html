  <p class="body">Emmanuel De Moor is Assistant Professor with the George S. Ansell Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering at the Colorado School of Mines.  He received his MS and PhD degrees in Materials Engineering from the University of Ghent, Belgium.  His research interests pertain to physical metallurgy of ferrous alloys and understanding interrelationships between properties, microstructure, alloying and processing history.  He is involved in advanced high strength sheet, plate, wire, rail and forging steel research at the advanced steel processing and products research center, an industry-university cooperative research center at Colorado School of Mines.  He currently teaches metallurgical and materials thermodynamics and iron and steelmaking.  He is a recipient of the AIST Kent D. Peaslee junior faculty award, the SAE/AISI Sydney H. Melbourne Award for Excellence in the Advancement of Automotive Sheet Steel and the 2016 Outstanding Young Manufacturing Engineer Award. </p>
