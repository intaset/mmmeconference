  <p class="body">Hong Yong Sohn received his B.S. degree from Seoul National University in Korea and his Ph.D. degree in Chemical Engineering in 1970 from the University of California at Berkeley.  After working as a Research Engineer at Du Pont’s Engineering Technology Laboratory, he joined the Department of Metallurgical Engineering at the University of Utah in 1974 and currently holds the rank of <b>Distinguished Professor</b>. Professor Sohn’s work has been recognized through various awards, which include the 2014 <b>Educator Award</b> from TMS; the <b>Distinguished Scholarly and Creative Research Award</b>, 2012, University of Utah; <B>Billiton Gold Medal</b>, 2012, The Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining, U.K.; the <b>TMS 2009 Fellow Award</b>, “in recognition of outstanding contribution to the practice of metallurgical/materials science and technology,” from The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society (TMS); the 2001 <b>James Douglas Gold Medal Award</b> (“for leadership and outstanding contributions in research and education of nonferrous extractive metallurgy and for work related to the modeling of gas-solid reactors and the development of novel solvent extraction systems”) from the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers (AIME); <b>Fellow Award</b> from the Korean Academy of Science and Technology, 1998; the TMS <b>Champion H. Mathewson Gold Medal Award</b> (1993 “for the most notable contribution to Metallurgical Science in the 3–year period”); the TMS <b>Extractive Metallurgy Lecturer Award</b> (1990 “in recognition as an outstanding scientific leader in the field of nonferrous extraction and processing metallurgy”); the TMS <b>Extraction and Processing Science Award (1990, 1994, 1999 and 2007)</b>; the <b>Fulbright Distinguished Lecturer</b> (1983); and the <b>Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation Teacher-Scholar Award</b> (1977). In 2006 TMS honored Dr. Sohn by holding the “<b>Sohn International Symposium on Advanced Processing of Metals and Materials</b>” in 2006.</p>

  <p class="body">Dr. Sohn has authored or co-authored 4 monographs, 25 book chapters, 5 patents, some 500 papers, co-edited 17 books, and delivered some 240 invited lectures.  He has served as a <b>Director of TMS-AIME</b> (The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society), organized many international symposia, and delivered numerous plenary and keynote lectures. He was a U.S. DOE <b>Fossil Energy Lecturer,</b> 1978–81, and is an <b>Advisor</b> to LS-Nikko Co., Korea and to Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources (KIGAM). He serves on several editorial/advisory boards of international journals.</p>

  <p class="keynote-topic"><b>Topic of Keynote:</b> Development of a Flash Ironmaking Technology Based on Hydrogen or Natural Gas - Implications on Energy and Greenhouse Gas Emissions</p>

  <p class="bold">Prof. Yuyuan Zhao</p><img src="../img/Zhao.jpg" width="270" align="right" class="keynote-img">
  <p class="body">Prof. Yuyuan Zhao obtained his BEng and MSc degrees from Dalian University of Technology, and PhD degree from Oxford University. He worked as a Lecturer at Dalian University of Technology, a Research Associate at the MADYLAM Laboratory of CNRS, and a Research Fellow at Birmingham University, before he joined Liverpool University in 1998 as a Lecturer. He was subsequently promoted to Senior Lecturer, Reader and then Professor.</p>
  <p class="body">He is currently the Head of Centre for Materials and Structures, a Department of the School of Engineering, the University of Liverpool. He is a Chartered Engineer (CEng) and a Fellow of the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining (FIMMM). He is a member of the Particulate Engineering Committee, the British Composites Society Committee, the ASM/TMS Composite Materials Committee and the Editorial Board of Powder Metallurgy. He served as the President of the Liverpool & North Wales Materials Society and in a number of scientific committees of international conferences.</p>
  <p class="body">Dr. Zhao’s research work has covered many areas, including plasma carburising of steels, manufacturing of fibre-reinforced metal matrix composites, vacuum plasma spraying, spray forming and powder production by centrifugal atomization, and the manufacture, characterisation and applications of porous metals and metal matrix syntactic foams.</p>
  <p class="body">He pioneered the Sintering and Dissolution Process (SDP) for manufacturing aluminium foam, which inspired the subsequent developments of several powder-based space-holder methods for manufacturing metal foams. He further invented the Lost Carbonate Sintering (LCS) process, a more versatile and cost-effective method for producing micro-porous metals. The LCS technology has led to the creation of Versarien, a highly successful start-up company which was floated on London Stock Market in 2013.</p>
  <p class="body">Dr. Zhao was awarded the Ivor Jenkins Medal in 2015 by the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining for his contribution to powder metallurgy in developing and commercialising innovative powder based technologies for manufacturing metal foams.</p>
